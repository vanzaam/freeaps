## Smartphone requirements

- All iPhones which support iOS 15 and up.

## Supported pumps

To control an insulin pump OpenAPS uses modified [rileylink_ios](https://github.com/ps2/rileylink_ios) library, thus supporting the same pump list:

- Medtronic 515 or 715 (any firmware)
- Medtronic 522 or 722 (any firmware)
- Medtronic 523 or 723 (firmware 2.4 or lower)
- Medtronic Worldwide Veo 554 or 754 (firmware 2.6A or lower)
- Medtronic Canadian/Australian Veo 554 or 754 (firmware 2.7A or lower)
- Omnipod "Eros" pods

To control an insulin you need to have a [RileyLink](https://getrileylink.org), OrangeLink, Pickle, GNARL, Emalink, DiaLink or similar device

## Current state of OpenAPS

OpenAPS is in an active development state and changes frequently.

You can find a description of versions on the [releases page](https://github.com/ivalkou/freeaps/releases).

A stable version means that it has been tested for a long time and does not contain critical bugs. We consider it ready for everyday use.

Stable version numbers end in **.0**.

### Beta versions

Beta versions are the first to introduce new functionality. They are designed to test and identify issues and bugs.

**Beta versions are fairly stable, but may contain occasional bugs.**

Beta numbers end with a number greater than **0**.
